# neoreef
NeoReef is an immersive AR/VR platform that transforms ecological data into interactive 3D layers over realistic models of Earth’s surface. It integrates:

Global datasets (satellite SST, terrain, NOAA coral alerts)

In-situ photomosaics (3D coral reef scans, diver-collected imagery)

Drone/UAV imagery (high-resolution aerial maps)

Users can:

Visualize climate data (e.g., bleaching risk) over 3D reefs.

Explore time-lapse layers (e.g., coral growth/decline).

Collaborate via shared annotations in VR/AR.

Goal: Enhance research, education, and conservation through dynamic, layered environmental storytelling.

(Tagline: "The Living Twin of Earth’s Ecosystems")

Key Features
3D Data Layers

Overlay SST, pH, or storm impacts on terrain.

Photogrammetry Integration

Fuse drone/diver mosaics with global models.

XR Interaction

Annotate, measure, and simulate in AR/VR.

Example Use Case:
A marine biologist inspects a 3D reef model, toggling between 2020 (healthy) and 2024 (bleached) drone scans, while SST anomaly layers highlight heat stress causes.
